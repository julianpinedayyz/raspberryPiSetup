# raspberryPiSetup
Initial setup and steps to get a respberry pi up and running.

After repeating all these steps over and over, I decide to make this repo and have all the steps clear so anyone can repeat then and get their rasberry pi up and running.  I will be seting up a MEAN environmnet using Nginx and some other tools to make life easier.

##Setup SD Card for Noobs

There are plenty of tutorials around the web that talk about this step.  I will be skiping this part and assume you'll get it ready on your own.  For a quick reference you can see this [link](http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/).  It is a pretty good reference.

##Initial boot (Installing the OS)

After inserting the SD Card with Noobs for the first time, you'll get the initital screen where you can install any OS.  What I normally do:

* Select Raspbian as my OS
* Change language to English (US)

This steps are cover in the link mentioned above.

##Raspi-config

After the OS gets installed, the Pi will reboot and load raspi-config for the first time.  These are the steps that I normally follow:

* Enable SSH access
* Change the hostmane for the Pi
*
